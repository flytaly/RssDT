      <title>Distributed Event-Driven Infrastructure to Augment Your Existing API Architecture</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/distributed-event-driven-infrastructure-to-augment?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The latest Streamdata.io Distribute™ release has a number of new features, but one of the most significant shifts for the product is the move to be a containerized solution over just being a SaaS solution. We feel this shift represents where the API infrastructure space has been headed for a while now. While we still need a SaaS solution to help folks get up and running quickly, having a containerized solution reflects how API infrastructure will be delivered, scaled, and allow companies to deliver seamless API-driven solutions across their operations.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://streamdata.io/product/sdio-on-docker/" target="_blank"&gt;latest release &lt;/a&gt;of Streamdata.io event-driven infrastructure, which we now call &amp;quot;Distribute,&amp;quot; can be deployed as a Docker container. Allowing our streaming infrastructure to be deployed alongside existing infrastructure, and controlled using microservices. All the features of the new solutions are available through a set of management APIs, allowing for orchestration of the entire platform, and seamless integration with existing API infrastructure. Dramatically shifting how you can put Streamdata.io to work within the enterprise, augmenting your existing API infrastructure with event-driven solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>NoSQL vs. SQL: Differences Explained</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/nosql-vs-sql-differences-explained?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;p pid="1"&gt;A common thread in technology — or for that matter, just about anything humans attempt over time — is &lt;em&gt;evolution&lt;/em&gt;. It's not unusual, then, to see things grow and adapt as the world around them changes. That very adaptation means that sometimes older variations of our favorite tools remain, while newer variations appear alongside them to better serve certain, specific purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p pid="2"&gt;The database world is no exception. Since the days of E.F. Codd and his introduction of the &lt;em&gt;relational data model&lt;/em&gt;, we've seen data stores and their requirements grow from purely transactional models doing ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable), to requiring more flexibility, ability to scale (via distributed deployment), and speed (in terms of latency and throughput). These improvements may, in many cases, be at the very &lt;em&gt;expense&lt;/em&gt; of what made RDBMS solutions preferable in the first place. But how to know?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Does a Hamburger Menu Belong in a WinForms App?</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/does-a-hamburger-menu-belong-in-a-winforms-app?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;p pid="3"&gt;User interfaces are constantly evolving in a bid to make every user of an application a power user. We build applications with lots of great features and capabilities and we want these to be readily available and easily accessible to the end user.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Is it Familiar or Intuitive?&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p pid="4"&gt;When I use a piece of software there are usually three different kinds of UIs I encounter. First are the interactions I am already familiar with from other apps, such as a menu at the top, or a ribbon bar, or a multiple document interface. Second come the new things that are very intuitive as to how they are supposed to be used. This is what we usually refer to as awesome UI/UX — it's something I’m not familiar with but at the same time something that I seem to know how to use. Once such thing for me was&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_menu" target="_blank" title=""&gt;radial menus&lt;/a&gt;. Although they have not gained much traction, I immediately felt comfortable using one right from the word go. The third kind are things hidden somewhere in the application that are sometimes impossible to find without external help, e.g. a functionality that has a shortcut but no other way of accessing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beware What You Don't Measure</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/beware-what-you-dont-measure?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When there's an IT outage, businesses suffer. The faster you can get the business back up and running, the better it is for all involved. Let's take a look at some of the best practices for automating major incident management, and place the focus on the importance of measuring time to restore service properly. Let's take a look at some common metrics, and remember to beware what you don't measure.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mean Time to Repair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;MTTR (Mean Time to Repair) is one of the most important and most common metrics for &lt;a href="https://www.xmatters.com/use-cases/major-incident-management-mim/" target="_blank"&gt;major incidents&lt;/a&gt;. Just divide the total maintenance time by the number of incidents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can Fake Patient Data Drive AI in Healthcare?</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/can-fake-patient-data-drive-ai-in-healthcare?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, AI systems require vast quantities of data to train on, but it's increasingly possible to train algorithms on data that is largely fake. In many domains, this isn't really necessary as data is so abundant, but in healthcare, this isn't always the case, especially for very rare conditions.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10225" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published by NVIDIA, MG, and BWH Center for Clinical Data Science and the Mayo Clinic explores how generative adversarial networks (GANs) can help to overcome a lack of data by artificially generating it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p pid="2"&gt;Recently, I gave a two hour lecture on &amp;quot;Big Data and Artificial Intelligence,&amp;quot; to use some buzzwords, as asked. More honestly, it will be on (new) data and (new) algorithms for predictive modeling. Slides are &lt;a href="http://freakonometrics.free.fr/ESCP.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;now online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Internal Threats Are Far More Dangerous Than External Threats</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/internal-or-insider-threats-are-far-more-dangerous?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;p pid="4"&gt;In the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://ibm.biz/2016CyberIndex" target="_blank"&gt;2016&amp;nbsp;Cyber Security Intelligence Index&lt;/a&gt;, IBM found that 60 percent of all attacks were carried out by insiders that you trust. Of these attacks, three-quarters involved malicious intent, and one-quarter involved careless negligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p pid="4"&gt;Cyber thieves use personal information to launch spear phishing attacks and commit fraud with social security numbers to steal medical identities and obtain fraudulent prescriptions. IBM Security research found healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services to be the top three industries under attack, due to their amounts of personal data, intellectual property, physical inventory, and massive economic assets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p pid="15"&gt;Since a book series called &amp;quot;... for Dummies&amp;quot; was launched, people have finally come to realize how much they don't know about the particular area they thought they previously knew about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p pid="1"&gt;We've all started from somewhere. Self-learning, learning at school or even in the office at our jobs. A breakthrough was achieved when we realized that something absolutely strange to us, became quite familiar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Success Criteria: 21 Years of Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/success-criteria-21-years-of-software-engineering?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;
 Oct 2018: The fact that people — well, companies mostly — have been doing me the great courtesy of paying me to produce software for them for more than 21 entire years leaves me feeling incredibly lucky — and faintly horrified at just how quickly that time has passed. Increasingly often, new grads joining me in the workplace will be younger than the bugs I've left behind, so it seems a good time to pause and reflect!
 &lt;p&gt;Have I learned anything in 21 years of professional software development? Well, yeah, a whole bunch of stuff! I've been paying &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; attention!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Some of it's obsolete now, not least all the cool Excel stuff I could do before Microsoft excreted its damned Office Ribbon thing into the world thing leaving me unarmed and bewildered. But some of it could, perhaps, by particularly kind observer, be called some form of wisdom. Facts, anyway. Experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Get Connected Quiz: Are You Ready to Transform Your Business?</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/the-get-connected-quiz-are-you-ready-to-transform?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;p pid="7"&gt;I hope you’ve&lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/tag/getconnected/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt; gotten connected with me&lt;/a&gt; these last several weeks. I was talking to a colleague about why I wrote these. And it really comes down to one thing: IoT is taking place all around us. Are you and your company participating in digital transformation and impacting the physical world? Or, are you just watching it happen?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p pid="8"&gt;Thirty years ago, we thought about reducing data in the data center. Now, with IoT, we’re thinking about amassing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; data from all sources, along with all the combinations you can now blend together for new insights. It’s a paradigm shift!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>H2O World London 2018: A Report</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/h2o-world-london-2018-a-report?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;section itemprop="text"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="http://h2oworld.h2o.ai" target="_blank"&gt;H2O World&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest minds in AI, Data Science, and mathematics gather during one huge machine learning-oriented community event. There is a series of training&amp;nbsp;and presentations focused not only at H2O.ai Machine Learning platform but also on theoretical and applied AI and Machine Learning topics in general. This H2O World in London was the biggest one so far. The whole event is organized by countless H2O makers, led by Qybare Pula, Ian Gomez,&amp;nbsp;and Saurabh Kumar.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2 id="day-one"&gt;Day One&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The very first day was a day of intense hands-on training. After a morning coffee, the &lt;a href="https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o-driverless-ai/" target="_blank"&gt;Driverless AI&lt;/a&gt; Hands-On Training started. There were over eight-hundred people gathered in the beautiful environment of London Hilton on Park Lane, waiting to try various aspects of Driverless AI on their own. The Driverless AI panel lasted for the whole forenoon, with only a small break. After an introduction to the basics of Driverless AI by H2O’s CTO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArnoCandel" target="_blank"&gt;Arno Candel&lt;/a&gt;, more advanced blocks on how feature engineering or NLP are handled in Driverless AI by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DmitryLarko" target="_blank"&gt;Dmitry Larko&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sudalairajkumar" target="_blank"&gt;Sudalai Rajkumar&lt;/a&gt;. Attendees also observed Kaggle grandmasters &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StackNet_" target="_blank"&gt;Marios Michailidis&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller" target="_blank"&gt;Mathias M&amp;uuml;ller&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p pid="17"&gt;The conciseness of Java 8 lambda expressions sheds a new light on classic &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" target="_blank"&gt;GoF design patterns&lt;/a&gt;. By leveraging functional programming, we can get the same benefits with much less coupling and ceremony – the Template method is a great example of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Classic GoF Template Method Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p pid="18"&gt;The template method design pattern is one of 23 design patterns described by the Gang of Four – utilizing it makes it easy to conform to the &lt;a href="https://stackify.com/solid-design-open-closed-principle/" target="_blank"&gt;Open-Closed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?HollywoodPrinciple" target="_blank"&gt;Hollywood&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;principles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p pid="2"&gt;The voice of the customer (VOC) is an IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_the_customer" target="_blank"&gt;term&lt;/a&gt; that describes the in-depth process of capturing customer expectations, preferences, and aversions. It is a market research technique that produces a detailed set of customer wants and needs, organized into a hierarchical structure, and then prioritized in terms of relevant importance and satisfaction with current alternatives. Originally developed in the UK as a series of books to explain procedures and best practices for the IT industry to follow, many organizations adopted disciplines from ITIL in their software delivery lifecycle (SDLC) and IT operations management (ITOM) practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p pid="3"&gt;For a quicker feedback mechanism, companies are adopting NPS&amp;reg; or Net Promoter Score. NPS surveys your software end users with one simple question: “How likely is it that you would recommend this company or product to a friend or colleague?” Software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform companies collect NPS from their customer base by layering a dynamic feedback footer bar in their web-based application. One popular product called Wootric enables customer surveys inside SaaS, mobile apps or websites with a snippet of JavaScript. Either VOC or NPS allows organizations to align company efforts around customer needs, desires and willingness to recommend a product and the company behind it. Both measurements help monitor trends, improve retention, increase referrals and prioritize the feature roadmap of customer-facing software.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Don't Just Think Database DevOps — Think Compliant Database DevOps</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/dont-just-think-database-devops-think-compliant-da?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;p pid="2"&gt;The 2018 &lt;a href="https://cloudplatformonline.com/2018-state-of-devops.html" target="_blank"&gt;Accelerate State of DevOps Report&lt;/a&gt; from DORA specifically calls out database development as a key technical practice which can drive high performance in DevOps. It's an interesting shift in our understanding of what should be included in DevOps workflows because it moves the database from being a bottleneck in the process to being a participant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p pid="4"&gt;At the same time, however, new data protection laws are coming into play and consumers are more aware than ever before of how their privacy can be compromised. So how can the promise of releasing changes to the database faster and easier be balanced with the need to keep data safe and remain compliant with legislation?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exploring AWS Lambda Deployment Limits</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/exploring-aws-lambda-deployment-limits?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;p pid="35"&gt;In one of our last articles, we explored how we can deploy Machine Learning models using AWS Lambda. Deploying ML models with AWS Lambda is suitable for early-stage projects as there are certain limitations in using Lambda function. However, this is not a reason to worry if you need to utilize AWS Lambda to its full potential for your Machine Learning project. When working with Lambda functions its a constant worry about the size of deployment packages for a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p pid="2"&gt;Let’s first have a look at the AWS Lambda deployment limits and address the 50 MB package size in the AWS official documentation which is kind of delusive as you can make larger deployments of uncompressed files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>5 Questions to Ask Before Launching Your Citizen Development Strategy</title>

As a CIO or IT professional, maybe you're already convinced of the benefits of citizen development and ready to get it moving. But where to start first? What is your vision for citizen development within your organization? What do you hope to achieve with citizen developers and a no- or low-code platform?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It is likely that many people in your organization will not yet be familiar with citizen development, and more still will need to be convinced of not only its value, but also its viability. You'll have to convince them of the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; for your pursuit of citizen development in order to educate, generate support, and keep an overall vision central for all stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beyond Logs, Metrics, and Tracing: Five Ways to Up Your Observability Game</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/beyond-logs-metrics-and-tracing-five-ways-to-up-yo?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;p pid="2"&gt;Early on in the cloud adoption cycle, businesses and technology professionals focused more on new applications designed to deliver transformative results. Fast-forward to today, when cloud service providers are providing services to make mission-critical application delivery more affordable &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; enterprise teams learn how to take advantage of those services. For teams who make the transition, cloud may enable frictionless consumption of services and newfound flexibility. Unfortunately, that’s a big “if.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p pid="7"&gt;Cloud has become somewhat of a double-edged sword for today’s tech professionals. For all its benefits, the cloud also brings increased opacity, diminished observability, and can present novel issues, at least in the short term. While IT expects the same level of durability, service delivery, and observability as on-prem, the cloud is an entirely different environment and requires a different approach, with new tools and new skills to master.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Create a Threat Model for Cloud Infrastructure Security</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-create-a-threat-model-for-cloud-infrastruct?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;p pid="17"&gt;The practice of creating a threat model can help teams proactively understand and develop a strategy for managing the possible vulnerabilities their organization faces, instead of waiting until after an incident occurs. OWASP defines&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Threat_Modeling" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt;threat modeling&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as “a procedure for optimizing security by identifying objectives and vulnerabilities, and then defining countermeasures to prevent, or mitigate the effects of, threats to the system.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p pid="3"&gt;SecOps teams can benefit from creating a threat model for cloud infrastructure and defining an approach to operationalizing, hardening, and automating security throughout the software development lifecycle. While it’s best to build security into the design of your systems at the outset, remember the motto: &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p pid="2"&gt;Up to this point, performance testing has been on the server side of things as JMeter does not include the time needed to render the response, nor does JMeter process any client code, for example, JavaScript.

      <title>[DZone Research] Factors Separating Web and Mobile Development</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/dzone-research-factors-separating-web-and-mobile-d?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;p pid="6"&gt;To gather insights on the current and future state of web and mobile development we talked to 19 IT executives and we asked, &amp;quot;Do you see any factors that still separate web from mobile development in organizations?&amp;quot; Here's what they told us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 pid="11" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: &amp;amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.2; color: rgb(34, 38, 53); margin: 20px 0px 5px; font-size: 30px; clear: both; letter-spacing: -0.5px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt;Skillset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px 0px 8px;"&gt;&lt;strong style="box-sizing: border-box; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"&gt;Expertise and experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;There is a movement to bring all application development back in-house.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Multiple things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid are trying to have the same skillsets.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Native if you need the newest features. Native requires a different skillset. We continue to keep&amp;nbsp;web and mobile separate.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;It's getting blurrier. Web dev is for desktop and mobile.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;There are challenges for developers to support desktop and mobile.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Both web and mobile have challenges. Web compensates for mobile. Mobile just worries about&amp;nbsp;small&amp;nbsp;real estate.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We see skills and technologies converging with React and JavaScript.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;There are&amp;nbsp;organizational issues as well.&amp;nbsp;Web&amp;nbsp;development is from marketing and app development is from&amp;nbsp;product&amp;nbsp;management. Does everything converge under IT? Don’t want to learn experience for&amp;nbsp;internal&amp;nbsp;apps. Need to work with design groups. Need a horizontal matrix to deliver the whole product experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;It depends on the industry and how a particular vertical is set up. &lt;strong&gt;There is&amp;nbsp;a skillset and mindset difference. &lt;/strong&gt;Web developers come from the marketing side then have the app developer and mobile developers from the IT side of the organization. They end up out of synch. They develop with two different objectives in mind. Need strong product management to integrate the two teams.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The look and feel are still fundamentally different in web and mobile development. Web is still mostly tied to HTML and CSS. Additionally, there is a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;lack of effective cross-training of developer skills which leads to separate delivery teams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 pid="2"&gt;Mobile First&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s just mobile-first design.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;There's a smaller bridge to build mobile. We still need design patterns that are mobile first and be cognizant of UI for mobile versus web. Multi-experience development platforms are emerging. Don’t code self into a box.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px 0px 8px;"&gt;Not really. With regards to web design, &lt;strong&gt;mobile-first is the mantra&lt;/strong&gt;. Will it look good on a mobile device and a large screen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 pid="4"&gt;PWA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The more traditional software companies like Salesforce and Slack are very advanced. Our customers like financial institutions, healthcare companies, and insurance companies with in-house development move more slowly. Capital One is on par with Slack and Salesforce. However, the more traditional companies with R&amp;amp;D are lagging two years behind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;WPA and React Native is only in 5 to 10% of customers.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;It’s early in the process. Software development companies are the first to adopt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Not with the advent of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Progressive Web Apps&lt;/strong&gt;; if anything, we see mobile development taking a more dominant approach to web app design and development, something that’s a bit overdue with most bloated web apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 pid="13" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: &amp;amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.2; color: rgb(34, 38, 53); margin: 20px 0px 5px; font-size: 30px; clear: both; letter-spacing: -0.5px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt;Other&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t see much blending of web and mobile development.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Bigger players want to unify of all of the platforms. Google is pushing for it. Apple is dipping their toe in it.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall less and less as time goes on.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Web&amp;nbsp;is no longer just desktop web. To us, “web” means desktop web and web on mobile. All of our enterprise customers have responsive web applications that run on both.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Organizations often hire outside contractors or specialized firms to write and maintain their mobile applications, while keeping their web development in-house.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;This leads to tension and communication challenges between the different teams.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Web development teams also tend to operate on longer release cycles than mobile teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>All Things You Need To Know About Exhaustive Testing</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/all-things-you-need-to-know-about-exhaustive-testi?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;What is Exhaustive Testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p pid="1"&gt;Exhaustive testing, which is also known as complete testing, occurs when all the testers in your team are exhausted and when all the planned tests have been executed. It is a quality assurance testing technique in which all scenarios or data is tested for testing. In a more understandable way, exhaustive testing means ensuring there are no undiscovered faults at the end of the test phase. Testing everything (all combinations of inputs and preconditions) is not feasible except for trivial cases. As testers, we often say, “Well I just never have enough time for testing.” Even if you had all the time in this world, you still wouldn’t have enough time to test all the possible input combinations and output combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strategies for Exhaustive Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p pid="2"&gt;We know that one of the &lt;a href="https://testautomationresources.com/software-testing-basics/exhaustive-testing-fundamentals/" target="_blank"&gt;7 testing principles of software testing&lt;/a&gt; says that exhaustive testing is not possible. Now the question is that, as exhaustive testing is not possible, how we are supposed to get enough coverage to tell that the application under test is tending to not having any defects?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Microservices Logging Best Practices</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/microservices-logging-best-practices?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;p pid="2"&gt;&lt;a href="http://microservices.io/"&gt;Microservice architecture&lt;/a&gt; is an application structure that fosters the use of a loosely coupled system to allow you to develop, test, deploy, and release services independently of each other. These services are part of a unique system, and the idea behind using microservices is to break a big problem in smaller problems. Usually, each service interacts with the others through an HTTP endpoint, hiding the details of its technology stack by exposing only a contract to its consumers. Service A will call Service B, which at the same time calls Service C. Once the request chain is complete, Service A might be able to respond to the end customer that initiated the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p pid="3"&gt;Microservice architecture offers a lot of great benefits like the ability to use different technology stacks, deploy independently, solve small problems one at a time, and more! But using microservices comes with a high cost in that they are complex...not only in how they communicate but also in how to manage them. And they get even more complicated when one or more services fail. Which service failed? Why, and under what circumstances? All these questions are hard to answer if you don't have good, meaningful logs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How the Penguin Became a Benedictine Monk: Open Source and Codes of Community Conduct</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/how-the-penguin-became-a-benedictine-monk-open-sou?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;p pid="2"&gt;Recently, a popular open source database project, SQLite,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/22/sqlite_code_of_conduct/" target="_blank" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt;adopted a code of conduct for its participants&lt;/a&gt;. Codes of conduct are not news — they have become increasingly common in open source communities in recent years. But this one was different: the project adopted Rule IV of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Rule_of_Saint_Benedict" target="_blank" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt;Rule of Saint Benedict&lt;/a&gt;, written in the 6th century by Saint Benedict of Nursia, and still used as ethical precepts for the Benedictine order of monks. Rule IV,&lt;em&gt;Instruments of Good Works&lt;/em&gt;, contains such elements as “To do as one would be done by” — which is hard to argue with. But it also contains elements like “To deny oneself that one may follow Christ” and, “To be frequently occupied in prayer” — which were more controversial, and probably not applicable to code development. Well, maybe prayer helps to find some of the more elusive bugs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p pid="4"&gt;The actual reach of the code of conduct was limited. The project consisted of only a few developers who all agreed on it, and it was in place for months before anyone objected. The SQLite project&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sqlite.org/codeofethics.html" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the Rule:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deploying Spring Boot and MongoDB as Containers Using Kubernetes and Docker</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/deploying-spring-boot-and-mongodb-as-containers-us-1?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;p itemprop="alternativeHeadline"&gt;For this tutorial, you'll have a Dockerized sample spring-boot application that talks to MongoDB for GET/POST REST APIs and deployed in Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;minikube&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;kubectl&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;docker&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;maven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p pid="3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://docker.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; is a Linux container management toolkit with a “social” aspect, allowing users to publish container images and consume those published by others. A Docker image is a recipe for running a containerized process, and in this guide, we will build one for a simple Spring boot application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Guice Vs. Spring: Comparing Dependency Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/guice-vs-spring?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Both Guice and Spring are Dependency injection frameworks that connect the dots with right lines so that we can kick start our service. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p pid="1"&gt;Essentially, we use dependency frameworks to define which implementation to pick for an interface defined so that it is picked up automatically during runtime. Since dependencies are separated from an implementation, the code becomes more unit testable.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p pid="2"&gt;Let's take a look at the benefits of using (Google’s) Guice over Spring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Our 5G Futures at 5GTechritory</title>

      <description>&lt;p pid="2"&gt;The countries surrounding the Baltic Sea are renowned for their constant pushes for innovation. From Estonia's &amp;quot;Government-as-a-service&amp;quot; to Finland and Latvia having some of the fastest Internet speeds in the world, these are nations unafraid to try new ideas. These pushes include the next generation of mobile communication standards, with &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/worlds-first-5g-network-launches"&gt;the first commercial 5G networks launched&lt;/a&gt; in Tampere (Finland) and Tallinn (Estonia), years ahead of many other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p pid="3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G" target="_blank"&gt;5G&lt;/a&gt; is the fifth generation of the mobile communication standards we are currently using. It aims to continue the trends of increased speed and bandwidth, but also to introduce new features to complement our increasingly inter-connected world. These include reduced latency, lower power consumption, and less interference from areas with a high density of devices. 5G's aim is not to improve your mobile phone experience, but to better support the needs of all connected devices and reduce their reliance on outdated and unsuited communication technologies. It aims to help modern businesses operate in a connected ecosystem no matter where they are in the world (that has 5G). It aims to be the backbone that uses cases such as autonomous vehicles, telemedicine, and smart cities need to operate optimally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Couchbase Lite for Data Storage in Ionic App Using Cordova Plugin</title>
      <link>https://dzone.com/articles/couchbase-lite-for-data-storage-in-ionic-app-using?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dzone</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.couchbase.com/products/mobile" target="_blank"&gt;Couchbase Lite&lt;/a&gt; is an embedded NoSQL database for iOS, Android and .Net platforms. The framework's API supports &lt;a href="https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/2.1/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;native platform bindings&lt;/a&gt; for Android (Java), iOS (Swift, ObjC) and UWP/Xamarin (csharp). This implies that if you are building a Cordova app and you want to use Couchbase Lite as your embedded data persistence layer, you will have to find a way to access Couchbase Lite's native APIs from within your Cordova web application. You can accomplish that with &lt;a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en//latest/guide/hybrid/plugins/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cordova Plugins&lt;/a&gt;. Cordova plugins allow web-based apps running in a &lt;a href="https://cordova.apache.org" target="_blank"&gt;Cordova&lt;/a&gt; webview to access native platform functionality through a Javascript interface.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;At a high level, the architecture of a Cordova application that uses Cordova Plugins to access native code libraries is pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
